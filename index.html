    <h1>ViroidDB</h1>
    <p>
      Viroids and their (potential) relatives are among the most unique of all
      biological entities. However, I couldn't find a good, up-to-date database
      containing all of them in one place so I made my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      This database has sequences representing known viroid and viroid-like RNA
      sequences. Each sequence is unique, though variants of the same RNA
      species are included. Currently, sequences are <i>not</i> guaranteed to be
      rotationally unique, meaning that <code>AAAATTTT</code> is treated as
      distinct from <code>TTAAAATT</code>.
    </p>
    <h2>How to get the data</h2>
    <p>
      You can download the most recent version of the entire database as a FASTA
      file <a>here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, download the database easily using your command-line tool
      of choice:
    </p>
    <pre>$ curl viroids.org/db/latest/all.fasta > viroiddb.fasta</pre>

      <abbr title="noting, of course, that a set is a subset of itself">
        subset

      Archived versions of data are available for each release. Releases do not
      currently happen at a set interval due to the slow pace of viroid
      discovery, though I do hope to change that in the future. Previous
      releases can be accessed through URLs of the form
      <code>https://viroids.org/db/YYYY-MM-DD/subset</code>. Available releases:

      <li>2021-04-15</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How I curate the database</h2>
    <p>
      All data is publicly available from the NCBI. I have included what I
      believe to be a class of potentially related RNA agents that merit study
      as a group. The key inclusion criteria are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Circularity at some point in the replication cycle</li>
      <li>Extensive RNA folding</li>
      <li>The presence of ribozymes or a central conserved region</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To collect the sequences for the database I followed this protocol:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        For viroids and deltaviruses, I used the NCBI Virus portal to download
        complete sequences within the taxonomy IDs 185751, 185752, 265963 and
        39759 for Pospiviroidae, Avsunviroidae, unclassified viroids, and
        Deltavirus respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        For retrozymes, which are not taxonomically classified, I downloaded all
        sequences within
      </li>
    </ol>
