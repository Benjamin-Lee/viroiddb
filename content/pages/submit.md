Do you think that we missed data in the database?
If so, please let us know by filling out the form below and we will be happy to create another release and update the site.

The criteria for inclusion in the database are:

1. The sequence must be uniq
1. The data must be publicly available in an INSDC database
1. Sequences must be complete
1. Sequences must be unambiguous
  
However, exceptions could be considered, such as representatives of novel families, but would be evaluated on per case basis  
  
etc etc
