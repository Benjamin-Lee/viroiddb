Do you think that we missed data in the database?
If so, please let us know by filling out the form below and we will be happy to create another release and update the site.

In general, the criteria for inclusion in the database are:

1. The sequence must be rotationally unique.
   This means that the sequence must not only be unique, but so must every rotation in both polarities.
2. The data must be publicly available in an INSDC database
3. Sequences must be complete
4. Sequences must be unambiguous

However, exceptions to these rules could be considered, such as representatives of novel families, but would be evaluated on per case basis

etc etc
