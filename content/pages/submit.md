Do you think that we missed data in the database?
If so, please let us know by filling out the form below and we will be happy to create another release and update the site.

In general, the criteria for inclusion in the database are:

1. The sequence must be rotationally unique.
   This means that the sequence must not only be unique, but so must every rotation in both polarities.
2. The data must be publicly available in an [INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/) database.
3. Sequences must be complete and marked as such within the INSDC database.
4. Sequences must be unambiguous: each base must be `A`, `T`/`U`, `G`, or `C`.

However, exceptions to these rules, such as representatives of novel families, will be evaluated on per case basis.
