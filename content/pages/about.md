title: About ViroidDB
description: About us, about Viroids, and some in between.

This database is curated to cover the entirety of viroid-like RNA agents: Viroids, small circular satellite RNAs, the recently described realm of ribozyviruses (*i.e.*, hepatitis delta virus and its relatives), and retrozymes.   
Members of this unique group of agents are characterized by their small genome sizes (less than 2000 nt), highly structured circular genomes, use of self-cleaving ribozymes or co-opted host enzymes, and replication via the rolling circle mechanism. Pathogenic members infect both plants and animals, and reports of resulting diseases have been documented since the 1930s. Presently, the only effective means of disease control is the prevention of spread, and crop infection may cause up to a 40% reduction of yield. However, despite the ever-increasing diversity and host range of these agents, no database currently exists. The most recent such database, [the subviral RNA database](doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-6-24), was published 15 years ago and is no longer accessible.  

To better support computational and experimental research on these agents, we have manually compiled a database of nearly ten thousand viroid-like RNA sequences from the NCBI's nucleotide database and made them available for download at viroids.org. In addition to curating the respective INSDC accessions and sequences, we have performed considerable post-processing so that ViroidDB entries are consistently formatted, enabling their direct use in common downstream analyses (e.g. circular sequences are consistently rotated and all sequence sets are deduplicated and estimated to represent complete genomes). For use cases where the complete range of variation is undesirable, we have performed clustering to identify a representative sequence for each cluster when no reference sequence is available. The database is version controlled and accessible by web via a simple graphical user interface or by command-line interface for programmatic data retrieval. Furthermore, the database is permanently archived in the Zenodo repository, ensuring future accessibility.
