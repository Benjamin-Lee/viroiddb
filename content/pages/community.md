Beyond providing high-quality data, we also provide

## Email alias

Do you love viroids and viroid-like RNA agents as much as we do?
Show it off by getting your very own `@viroids.org` email address!
Email aliases are available at no cost to _bona fide_ members of the community with research interests relevant to viroids.

These aliases are provided via [ImproxMX](https://improvmx.com/) and are only able to receive mail.
Because of the third-party nature of the mail forwarding, we do not suggest receiving sensitive or important emails via an `@viroids.org` address.
Instead, we suggest thinking about it like a university's alumni email forwarding system: a service to the community but probably not your #1 choice of email.

## Slack

We maintain an active Slack channel that is open to anyone in the community who wishes to participate.
Invitations can be solicited by sending an email to slack@viroids.org with your name and research interests.
