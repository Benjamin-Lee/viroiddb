<!--
As with other biological entities, viroid-like RNAs form clusters of related sequences. However, performing clustering on circular RNAs can be challenging if the sequences are not rotated consistently. To make these analyses easier, we have performed circular rotation and clustering at various levels of identity. -->

Many downstream analyses rely on multiple sequence alignments (MSA). Circular entities present a challenge as every rotation of the sequences must be considered because variation in sequencing and assembly may result in nearly identical sequences failing to align due to having different origins. For this reason, we performed _k_-mer profile-based clustering followed by rotational alignment for each cluster. [Learn more &rarr;](/about#how-we-curate-the-database)
