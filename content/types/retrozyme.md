Retrozymes are a unique class of non-LTR retroelements. These entities consist of a single, non-coding, genomic segment, carrying a catalytic RNA motifs, mainly self cleaving hammerhead ribozymes (HHR). Some studies suggest Retrozymes are mobilized through circular (circRNA) intermediates. Retrozymes are often found in plants and animals cells, tough their exact distribution is likely to cover diverse, higlhy divergent eukaryotic lineages.
Their genomes size ranges between NN and NNN.  
While these entities share common structral similarties with other circular RNA entities (such as Virioids and Vioird-likes), it remains unclear wheter Retrozymes (along with Delta viruses) share a common ancestor with other circRNAs.
