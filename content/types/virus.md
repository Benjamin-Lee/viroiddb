Deltaviruses (such as the noturios Hepatitis D virus (HDV)) share common characteristics with viruses, satRNAs, and viroids. Formely, HDV is a satellite virus of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) limited to human hosts, although deltaviruses with hosts ranging from ducks to snakes to fish and insects have recently been discovered.  
Unlike other viruses, HDV has a circular structured genome and replicates via a rolling circle mechanism - with self-cleavage accomplished using unique ribozymes in both genomic polarities.   
Like viroids, HDV uses host polymerase II for (+) strand synthesis, though there is currently no consensus on the polymerase for (−) strand synthesis. Unlike viroids and other genetic elments in this database, HDV encodes a single open reading frame coding for two isoforms of the delta antigen protein in the (−) polarity.
